In educational institutions, managing and predicting student performance is vital in enhancing 
academic outcomes. This project introduces a Student Performance Prediction Management 
System (SPPMS) that leverages the power of data mining and warehousing techniques to forecast 
student performance. The system integrates various data sources, including academic records, 
demographic information, and extracurricular activities, to build comprehensive student profiles. 
Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean, transform, and integrate heterogeneous data 
into a centralized data warehouse. The predictive modelling phase employs data mining 
algorithms such as classification, regression, and clustering to extract meaningful patterns from 
the integrated data. These patterns are utilized to develop predictive models capable of forecasting 
student performance indicators such as grades, exam scores, and academic outcomes. This project 
is conceived with the vision of leveraging advanced analytics to gain actionable insights into 
factors influencing student academic success, facilitating informed decision-making for educators, 
administrators, and stakeholders.
